## LaTeX Outline for Sublime Text

### Overview

This is an adaptation for LaTeX projects of warmdev's original [SublimeOutline](https://github.com/warmdev/SublimeOutline).
It also uses modifications due to vlad-wonderkidstudio's [SublimeOutline](https://github.com/vlad-wonderkidstudio/SublimeOutline).

See these pages for more details.

This package allows to have a clickable table of contents for a LaTeX article file on a tab.

It is quite basic for the moment and in particular limited to (S|Subs|Subsubs)-ections.

NOTE: it needs a lot of review/polish!
